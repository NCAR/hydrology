SHARP is being designed to facilitate the demonstration and evaluation of variations in the real-time forecasting workflow for short, medium and seasonal range streamflow predictions. To date, it has centered on forecasting in selected medium-sized basins in the continental US. As the figure below illustrates, the philosophy behind SHARP recognizes that model-based streamflow forecasting depends critically on not only the hydrologic and associated models (e.g., river routing), but on a range of key methods and datasets including meteorological analyses, downscaling of weather and climate forecasts, model parameter estimation (ie, calibration), data assimilation, post-processing, and a robust capacity for verification and diagnostic evaluation.
